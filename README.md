# rendergitPlus

> Just show me the code.

Tired of clicking around complex file hierarchies of GitHub repos? Do you just want to see all of the code on a single page? Enter `rendergitplus`. Flatten any Git repository (local or remote) into a single, static HTML page with syntax highlighting, markdown rendering, and a clean sidebar navigation. Perfect for code review, exploration, and an instant Ctrl+F experience.

## Basic usage

Install and use easily with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Sohil876/rendergitPlus
rendergitplus https://github.com/karpathy/nanogpt    # Remote repository
rendergitplus /path/to/local/repo                   # Local repository
```

Alternatively, more manual pip install example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sohil876/rendergitPlus
cd rendergitPlus
pip install -e .
rendergitplus https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT   # Remote repository
rendergitplus /path/to/local/repo                   # Local repository
```

The code will:
1. Clone the repo (if URL) or use the local directory (if path)
2. Render its source code into a single static temporary HTML file
3. Automatically open the file in your browser

Once open, you can toggle between two views:
- **üë§ Human View**: Browse with syntax highlighting, sidebar navigation, visual goodies
- **ü§ñ LLM View**: Copy the entire codebase as CXML text to paste into Claude, ChatGPT, etc.

There's a few other smaller options, see the code.

## Contributing

I vibe coded this utility a few months ago but I keep using it very often so I figured I'd just share it. I don't super intend to maintain or support it though.
